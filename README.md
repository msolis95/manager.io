This is the final project for CS 121 Relational Databases at Caltech.
The goal of the project was to create a database that facilitated searching
for soccer players based on specific criteria. The database supports a
certain number of command-line queries as well as manager logins. Follow
the instructions below to try it out for yourself. Thank you!

Instructions for loading data on command-line:
Make sure you have MySQL downloaded and available through your
device's command-line.

First, enter MySQL:

    sudo mysql --local-infile=1

Not including the "mysql>" prompt, run the following lines of code on your command-line
to create an appropriate database in mySQL.

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE manageriodb;
    mysql> USE manageriodb;
    mysql> SOURCE setup-managerio.sql;
    mysql> quit;

If there are errors involving the load-data.sql file, run all of the previous lines one more time.

Instructions for Python program:
Please install the Python MySQL Connector using the following line if not installed already.

    $ pip install mysql-connector-python

After loading the data and verifying you are in the correct database, 
run the following to open the Python application:

    $ python3 app.py
